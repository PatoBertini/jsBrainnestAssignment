1. Name the three ways to declare a variable?
var, let, const

2. Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
var because it has an global scope and it is inmutable

3. What rules should you follow when naming variables?
it must has relationship with the information it archieve. you can use camelcase or bem

4. What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and
strings?
it's concatenate strings and you have to use single/doble quotes. 'hello' + 'world

5. How does the % operator work?
The remainder operator (%) returns the remainder of the division between two operands.

6. Explain the difference between == and ===.
=== it means strictly equal and compares if two operands are same in type and value. Returns a boolean result. t/f
== regular equal, and compares only the value not type of elements.

7. When would you receive a NaN result?
is a propiety of an object that declares its not a number. eg: '2' + 2

8. How do you increment and decrement a number?
let number = 0
const adding = number++ (adds one to)

9. Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement
operators.
If used postfix, with operator after operand (for example, x++), the increment operator increments and returns the value before incrementing.
If used prefix, with operator before operand (for example, ++x), the increment operator increments and returns the value after incrementing.

10. What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
determinate the order in which operators are evaluated one respect the other. you can handled with ()
11. How do you log information to the console?
const data = 'Hello World'
console.log('data')

12. What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?
The unary plus (+) precedes its operand and evaluates to its operand. It attempts to convert the operand to a number, if it isn't already.


13. What are the eight data types in JavaScript?
String. Number. Boolean. Null.
Undefined. Symbol. BigInt. Object.

14. Which data type is NOT primitive?
Objects

15. What is the relationship between null and undefined?
undefined is a variable that refers to something that doesn't exist, and the variable isn't defined to be anything. null is a variable that is defined but is missing a value.

16. What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings? 
there is no real difference between using single quotes, double quotes but with backticks you can use javascript variables in the string

17. What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?
JavaScript string interpolation is the process of embedding an expression into part of a string.

18. Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?
backticks

19. How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?
`${variable}`

20. How do you escape characters in a string?
\ is a special character within a string used for escaping

21. What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string methods?
slice() extracts parts of a string and returns the extracted parts in a new string.
substr() extracts parts of a string, beginning at the character at the specified position, and returns the specified number of characters.
substring() extracts parts of a string and returns the extracted parts in a new string.

22. What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT), ??

23. What are the comparison operators?
Equal ( == )	Returns true if the operands are equal.
Not equal ( != )	Returns true if the operands are not equal.
Strict equal ( === )	Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. 

24. What are truthy and falsy values?
Truthy values are values that evaluate to True in a boolean context. Falsy values are values that evaluate to False in a boolean context

25. What are the falsy values in JavaScript?
There are only six falsey values in JavaScript: undefined , null , NaN , 0 , "" (empty string), and false 

26. What are conditionals?
Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run

27. What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?
if (condition) {
  //  console.log('ok')
} else {
 // console.log('wrong')
}

28. What is the syntax for a switch statement?
switch (expresiÃ³n) {
  case value1:
    //code
    break;
  case value2:
    //code
    break;


29. What is the syntax for a ternary operator?
condition ? expr1 : expr2 


30. What is nesting?
Nesting is when you write something inside of something else. You can have a function inside of another function

31. What are functions useful for?
allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want.

32. How do you invoke a function?
calling it -> nameFunction()

33. What are anonymous functions?
functions without name

34. What is function scope?
A function scoped variable means that the variable defined within a function will not accessible from outside the function.

35. What are return values?
The return statement is used to return a particular value from the function to the function caller. The function will stop executing when the return statement is called.
